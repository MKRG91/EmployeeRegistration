# EmployeeRegistration
Company Console Application w/ Java

This console application lets the user register employees in two different departments of the company (Developers and Admins).
It checks for every newly inserted employee if their username exists and if yes it shows the corresponding message and restarts. If
no then it registers the new employee and prints the corresponding message. It uses ArrayLists to store the usernames dynamically instead
of a database and there are no packages implemented. Again feel free to use or change the source code and if you do just mention somewhere
in your project this gitHub profile.
